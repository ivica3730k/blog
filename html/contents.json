This script is triggered by a pull request and checks out the code, performs an envsubst on the provider_secrets_template file with environment variables, sets up the Terraform provider, initializes Terraform with a new backend configuration file, validates the Terraform code, and runs Terraform plan.\n\nIf the validation and plan succeed, the script outputs the results to a comment on the pull request. If either the validation or plan fails, the script outputs the error message to a comment and fails the build. The action has permission to read the contents and write issues and pull requests.\n\nThe script uses a standardized template for Terraform plan on pull request to branch made by @ivica3730k, and users can customize it by changing the branch names, environment name, and secret names.\n\nThe snippet is written in YAML and uses GitHub Actions, which is a feature of GitHub that automates tasks in a GitHub repository. The script runs on the ubuntu-latest environment and uses the hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2 action to set up the Terraform provider. The script also uses the peter-evans/create-or-update-comment@v2 action to output the results to a comment on the pull request.\n\n### Pushes to the branch\n\nThis is a YAML file that defines a GitHub Action called \"Terraform apply on push to main.\" The purpose of this action is to automate the validation and application of Terraform code when changes are pushed to the main branch of a repository.\n\nThe action is triggered by a push event to the main branch, and it runs on an Ubuntu environment. The job it performs is called \"terraform-apply,\" and it has permissions to read the contents of the repository and write issues and pull requests.\n\nThe action sets environment variables for the Terraform command to run, which are sourced from the repository secrets. It checks out the code, performs a substitution on the provider_secrets_template file with the environment variables, sets up the Terraform provider, initializes Terraform with the newly created backend configuration file, and validates the Terraform code. If validation is successful, it runs the Terraform apply command and outputs the results to a comment on the pull request. If validation or apply fails, it creates a GitHub issue with the error message and fails the build.\n\nThe YAML file includes several steps to accomplish these tasks, including checking out the code, extracting the branch name, performing envsubst, setting up Terraform provider, initializing Terraform with backend config, validating Terraform code, running Terraform apply, creating or updating an issue with a validate or apply error message, and failing the build if Terraform validate or apply fails.\n\nThe file includes environment variables for the Terraform command to run, which are sourced from the repository secrets. To use this action, you will need to change the branch names, environment name, and secrets names to match your repository's settings.\n\n### Table of Contents\n| Section  |\n| ---  |\n| [Abstract and Introduction](#abstract-and-introduction) | \n| [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) |\n| [Main](#main) |\n| [Tags](#tags) | \n",

It checks out the code, performs a substitution on the provider_secrets_template file with the environment variables, sets up the Terraform provider, initializes Terraform with the newly created backend configuration file, and validates the Terraform code. If validation is successful, it runs the Terraform apply command and outputs the results to a comment on the pull request. If validation or apply fails, it creates a GitHub issue with the error message and fails the build.</p>\n<p>The YAML file includes several steps to accomplish these tasks, including checking out the code, extracting the branch name, performing envsubst, setting up Terraform provider, initializing Terraform with backend config, validating Terraform code, running Terraform apply, creating or updating an issue with a validate or apply error message, and failing the build if Terraform validate or apply fails.</p>\n<p>The file includes environment variables for the Terraform command to run, which are sourced from the repository secrets. To use this action, you will need to change the branch names, environment name, and secrets names to match your repository’s settings.</p>\n<h3 id=\"table-of-contents\">Table of Contents <a class=\"heading-anchor-permalink\" href=\"#table-of-contents\">#</a></h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Section</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#abstract-and-introduction\">Abstract and Introduction</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#table-of-contents\">Table of Contents</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#main\">Main</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#tags\">Tags</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n",

Users define and provide data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language, or optionally JSON. Terraform generates an execution plan describing what it will do to reach the desired state, and then executes it to build the described infrastructure. As of May 2021, Terraform supports more than 90 infrastructure and service providers. Terraform is free and open-source software under the Mozilla Public License 2.0. \n\n### What is AWS App Runner?\nAWS App Runner is a fully managed container application service that makes it easy for developers to quickly deploy containerized applications from a source repository. You can use AWS App Runner to deploy and run containerized web applications that are accessible through a custom URL. You don't need to provision, scale, and manage servers to run your applications, because AWS App Runner automatically handles the infrastructure management.\n\n### What is S3?\nAmazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. This means customers of all sizes and industries can use it to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics. Amazon S3 provides easy-to-use management features so you can organize your data and configure finely-tuned access controls to meet your specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements. Amazon S3 is designed for 99.999999999% (11 9’s) of durability, and stores data for millions of applications for companies all around the world.\n\n### What is CloudFront?\nAmazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds, all within a developer friendly environment.\n\n## What is the plan?\nThe plan is to create a Terraform template for setting up a backend service on App Runner with frontend hosted on S3 + CloudFront.

They are known for their compact size, low profile, and ability to reduce interference from nearby sources. The history of ham radio loop antennas dates back to the early days of radio communication, where they were primarily used for shortwave listening.\n\nIn the 1920s, radio amateurs began experimenting with loop antennas for transmitting on the shortwave bands. They found that these antennas were more directional than the more traditional long wire antennas, and could provide improved signal strength and reduced interference. Over time, ham radio operators have continued to refine the design of loop antennas, and today they are commonly used for a variety of applications, including weak signal, direction finding, and even satellite communications.\n\nOne of the main advantages of ham radio loop antennas is their ability to reject interference from sources that are not in the plane of the loop. This makes them an ideal choice for urban environments where noise from power lines, automobiles, and other sources can be a problem. Additionally, loop antennas can be designed to be directional, allowing the operator to focus their signal in a specific direction, which can be useful for communicating over long distances.\n\nIn terms of construction, ham radio loop antennas can be made with a variety of materials, including copper wire, aluminum, and even PVC pipe. They can be as simple as a single wire loop or as complex as a multi-turn loop. The size and shape of the loop can also be varied to suit the needs of the operator.\n\nOverall, ham radio loop antennas have a long and rich history in the world of amateur radio, and they continue to be a popular choice among operators today due to their compact size, ability to reject interference, and directional capabilities.",
