# Potential Project Ideas
## What is it?
A simple repository used to keep tabs and notes about potential project ideas that I might to in the future. Being a software developer, I have a lot of ideas for projects, but I don't always have the time to work on them. This repo is a way to keep track of those ideas and to keep them organized. Also, not being a electrical engineer, electrical projects should be taken with a grain of salt. I'm sure there are a lot of mistakes in my projects, but I'm learning as I go. On the other hand, I am a licensed amateur radio operator, so there should be opportunities to combine all of my interests together.
## Why on GitHub?
I like Markdown!

## How to use this repo
Open a issue with connected branch for each project idea. Then use the template from templates to create a README.md file for the project. Put each project in a separate folder under projects directory. Then, create a pull request to merge the branch into master. Once the pull request is merged, the project should be added to the list below.
