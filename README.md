# Potential Post Ideas

## What is it?

A simple repository used to keep tabs and notes about potential post ideas that I might to in the future. Being a software developer, I have a lot of ideas for posts, but I don't always have the time to work on them. This repo is a way to keep track of those ideas and to keep them organized. Also, not being a electrical engineer, electrical posts should be taken with a grain of salt. I'm sure there are a lot of mistakes in my posts, but I'm learning as I go. On the other hand, I am a licensed amateur radio operator, so there should be opportunities to combine all of my interests together.

## Why on GitHub?

I like Markdown!

## How to use this repo

Open a issue with connected branch for each post idea. Then use the template from templates to create a README(dot)md file for the post. Put each post in a separate folder under posts directory. Then, create a pull request to merge the branch into master. Once the pull request is merged, the post should be added to the list below.
