# Markdown Folder to HTML

<!-- Short description of the project and what it is. -->
## Abstract and Introduction
This project, which is available here https://github.com/joakin/markdown-folder-to-html could be used to make a html site for this whole repository. It would be a good way to organize the projects and make them easier to navigate. It would also be a good way to learn how to use the project.

<!-- List the projects that could be related to this project. For example, if this project is a 2M Ham Radio Amplifier, then the related projects could be a 70cm Ham Radio Amplifier and a 6M Ham Radio Amplifier. -->
### Related Projects

<!-- List the goals of the project. For example, if this project is a 2M Ham Radio Amplifier, then the goals could be to build a 2M Ham Radio Amplifier that is capable of 100W output. -->
### Project Goals
- Create a html site for this repository using markdown-folder-to-html
- Create a script to automatically update the html site when a new project is added
- Host the html site on GitHub Pages or something cheap like S3

<!-- List the requirements of the project. For example, if this project is a 2M Ham Radio Amplifier, then the requirements could be W6PXL pallet, some coax, etc -->
### Project Requirements

<!-- Tags are used to categorize projects. For example, if this project is a 2M Ham Radio Amplifier, then the tags could be "Ham Radio", "Radio Engineering" -->
#### Tags
CICD, GitHub, Markdown, HTML, JavaScript, Node.js
