# SM0VPO 20m Loop Antenna
20M Band Loop Antenna based on the design by SM0VPO.

<!-- Short description of the project and what it is. -->
## Abstract and Introduction
Being a ham-radio operator and currently having RS918 HF transmitter I am in a need of appropriate antenna. I have been looking for a good antenna for a while and I have found a design by SM0VPO.

## About Loop Antennas
Ham radio loop antennas, also known as small transmit/receive (STL) antennas, are a popular choice among amateur radio operators. They are known for their compact size, low profile, and ability to reduce interference from nearby sources. The history of ham radio loop antennas dates back to the early days of radio communication, where they were primarily used for shortwave listening.

In the 1920s, radio amateurs began experimenting with loop antennas for transmitting on the shortwave bands. They found that these antennas were more directional than the more traditional long wire antennas, and could provide improved signal strength and reduced interference. Over time, ham radio operators have continued to refine the design of loop antennas, and today they are commonly used for a variety of applications, including weak signal, direction finding, and even satellite communications.

One of the main advantages of ham radio loop antennas is their ability to reject interference from sources that are not in the plane of the loop. This makes them an ideal choice for urban environments where noise from power lines, automobiles, and other sources can be a problem. Additionally, loop antennas can be designed to be directional, allowing the operator to focus their signal in a specific direction, which can be useful for communicating over long distances.

In terms of construction, ham radio loop antennas can be made with a variety of materials, including copper wire, aluminum, and even PVC pipe. They can be as simple as a single wire loop or as complex as a multi-turn loop. The size and shape of the loop can also be varied to suit the needs of the operator.

Overall, ham radio loop antennas have a long and rich history in the world of amateur radio, and they continue to be a popular choice among operators today due to their compact size, ability to reject interference, and directional capabilities.
